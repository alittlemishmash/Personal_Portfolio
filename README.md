# Personal_Portfolio

## Description

This is a personal portfolio webpage with links to my current and completed projects. This is a work in progress and will be added to and edited in the coming months. The purpose of this project was to showcase skills learnt in CSS styling and alignment, as well as being fully functional.

### Tasks Completed
- All HTML and CSS code written from scratch.
- Appropriate CSS code was used to create cohesive styling.
- Psuedo classes were used to make links more visually interactive.
- Media queriese were used to keep the page accessible and fully functional on a smaller screen.
