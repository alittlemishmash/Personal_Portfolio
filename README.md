# Personal_Portfolio

## Description

This is a personal portfolio webpage with links to my current and completed projects. This is a work in progress and will be added to and edited in the coming months. The purpose of this project was to showcase skills learnt in CSS styling and alignment, as well as being fully functional, regardless of screen size.

### Tasks Completed

- Self-written HTML and CSS content and code.
- Appropriate CSS code was used to create cohesive styling and alignment.
- Psuedo classes were used to make links more visually interesting
- A media query was used to make the page still fully functional and easily viewable on various screen sizes.

### Links

[Deployed Website](https://alittlemishmash.github.io/Personal_Portfolio/)

[Code Repository](https://github.com/alittlemishmash/Personal_Portfolio.git)



## Installation

The website can be viewed via the above URL link. Please note that the 'email' link will <u>only</u> automatically open to a user's selected mail application <i>if</i> the user has allowed that certain application to open links directly from websites. 
For any user who does not have this preference enabeled, they can simply right-click the 'email' link and select 'copy email address' to paste my email to their chosen mail application.


## Usage

This website can be viewed on any screen.

Please note that this is currently a work-in-progress (as of Dec 2023) and as such, 4 out of 5 'work' links will take the user to various websites unrelated nor created by me. These links were merely added to showcase my understanding of functioning hyperlinks and psuedo element styling properties.
